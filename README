Embedded BeatBox Application for the Beagle Bone Green

Written almost entirely by me with the exception of one Audio Mixer function to set the Volume

Guided by Brian Frasers CMPT 433 course

This BeatBox Application monitors the BBG's internal accelerometer to detect sharp hand movements,
like a drummer swinging a drumstick, and turns these sharp hand movements in to sounds played by our BeatBox

It uses the AUX for output, and can play multiple WAV files at once by utilizing a mixer to add the sounds together

It also communicates over UDP on the network and can be issued commands remotely

The application is threaded, and uses atomics to handle inter process synchronization

The tempo that the sounds are played is variable, as is the volume

These features can be actuated via the Joystick or via UDP packets
